The presence of P-gp and ceramide in EVs indicates the potential role of EV in mediating MDR, even though the mechanisms by which P-gp and ceramide-derived EVs can mediate MDR in prostate cancer are not clear.
Both of these pathways are known to be involved in the survival of prostate cancer cells.
The role of EVs in normal cellular growth and development has been reported as well as in the context of disease progression and cancer metastasis .
Understanding the effect on EV pathways of various drugs used to target prostate cancer will help us to understand the role of EVs in mediating MDR in prostate cancer. 
have reported the role of noncoding transcripts and transposable elements in stroma-derived exosomes in stimulating the activation of receptor RIG-I, which, in turn, activates the transcription factor STAT1-dependent signaling and Notch-3 in breast cancer cells, and accentuates the therapy resistance in tumor-initiating cells .
