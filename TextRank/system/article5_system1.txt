Besides summarizing new data published over the past year, this review has enabled us to give more comprehensive summaries of risk factors, approaches to prevention, and how understanding the biology of the breast may lead to new approaches to risk and prevention and also to expand on the all-important area of how to implement current risk prediction and preventive measures in the population (Table 1 ).
As proof of principle of this hypothesis, Cuzick and colleagues demonstrated in the IBIS-I prevention trial that women who had a more than 10% reduction in density with tamoxifen had a 70% reduction in risk of breast cancer risk but that for women with less or no reduction in density there was no reduction in risk.
Estrogen and the breast The most successful preventative approach to breast cancer to date, reducing the effects of estrogen on the breast, has come from an understanding of the biology of the ER and the knowledge that estrogen is synthesized in the breast and elsewhere after ovarian function decreases at menopause.
Although the improvement in the C-statistic shown in these studies is modest, a more relevant measure of the utility of adding density information to risk models is how much it improves the ability to identify women at different levels of absolute risk for breast cancer (for example, re-classification of women crossing threshold risk levels set for public health interventions such as enhanced screening or chemoprevention).
A randomized trial performed by the WHI of reduction of the proportion of fat in the diet resulted in a non-significant 8% reduction in the risk of breast cancer, but there was some confounding with weight loss .
