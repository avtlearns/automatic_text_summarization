2 Scatter plot of effects of SNPs on prostate cancer risk by their effects on BMI All-cause mortality There was little evidence that the two sets of independent height or BMI allele scores were associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality in men diagnosed with prostate cancer (see Supplementary Table 10 for associations of all 179 height SNPs and all-cause mortality and Supplementary Table 7 for associations of each of the 32 BMI SNPs with all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-specific mortality).
Prostate cancer-specific mortality Both sets of independent height allele scores were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer-specific mortality in men diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer (hazard ratio per one standard deviation increase in the first height allele score 1.10; 95 % CI 1.03, 1.19, p  = 0.008; and in the second height allele score 1.09; 95 % CI 1.05, 1.13, p  &lt; 0.001; p value for heterogeneity = 0.86; see Supplementary Table 8 for the association of prostate cancer-specific mortality and each of the 179 height SNPs).
However, the p values for heterogeneity for the association of the BMI allele score with all-cause mortality and the height allele score with prostate cancer-specific mortality by grade were 0.03 and &lt;0.001, respectively.
Table 2 Association of weighted height and BMI genetic risk scores with measured height and weight in 907 controls in ProtecT n Mean difference 95 % CI r 2 (%) F -statistic Lower limit Upper limit Height 907 0.26 0.20 0.33 6.31 67.6 BMI 901 0.12 0.06 0.19 1.46 13.6 To allow direct comparison of effect sizes, BMI and height phenotypic measurements and the genetic risk scores were normalized to mean zero and standard deviation one Associations of genetic risk scores with potential confounders in ProtecT Taller men were more likely to have managerial jobs, have lower PSA levels, and have joined the ProtecT study at a younger age (Table  3 ), but there was little evidence that the height genetic risk score was associated with any of the confounders except benign hypertrophy of the prostate (all p values &gt;0.05).
The strengths of the study include (1) the robust instruments developed from previous GWAS that explained a reasonable proportion of the variance in the phenotypes of interest, (2) the large sample size, and (3) the potential confounders which were associated with measured height and BMI within the ProtecT study were not associated with the genetic risk scores for height and BMI.
