The focus of this essay will be to discuss the relationship between cancer and inflammation along the organizing principle that the inflammatory response maintains physiological processes such as tissue homeostasis and repair after injury and that in this role, inflammation may be an ancillary, or perhaps inseparable, aspect of tumor development.
In addition to playing a critical role in tumor growth, such as by mediating angiogenesis, the inflammatory response may have a role in other aspects of progression, such as tissue invasion and metastasis.
In an extension of its physiologic role in mediating tissue repair or as a strategy in host defense to infection, the inflammatory response may play a role in providing survival and proliferative signals to initiated cells, thereby leading to tumor promotion.
Thus, in the presence of initiation and both tissue injury and massive cellular death, activation of an inflammation dependent tissue repair/compensatory proliferative response leads to tumor promotion.
The next step in understanding the relationship between homeostatic processes, such as compensatory proliferation, tissue repair, and host defense, and tumorigenesis will be to determine whether pattern recognition of disturbances in homeostasis are involved in tumorigenesis.
