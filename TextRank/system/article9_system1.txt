Further, lupeol doses resulted in the inhibition of TPA-induced activation of PI3K, phosphorylation of Akt, activation of NF- κ B and IKK α , and degradation and phosphorylation of I κ B α .
It has been observed that Cox-2 is upregulated after UV exposure in skin cells and is involved in the development of skin cancer .
Treatment of skin cancer A431 cells by silibinin resulted in cell growth inhibition and death, which was found to be coupled with a decrease in MAPK/ERK1/2 levels and an upregulation of SAPK/JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK activation .
UV Radiation Epidemiological data around the world have been evocative of that the exposure of skin to UV radiation is the main ecological carcinogen in the development of both melanoma and nonmelanoma types of skin cancers.
same doses of GSPs have the ability to protect the skin from the adverse effects of UVB radiation via modulation of the MAPK and NF- κ B pathways.
