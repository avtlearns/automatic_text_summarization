A. Risk from ever smoking Figures 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 (all lung cancer), Figures 6 , 7 (squamous) and Figure 8 , 9 (adeno) present the results of the main meta-analyses for ever smoking any product (or cigarette smoking for studies without RRs for any product), based on most-adjusted RRs.
Of the six characteristics studied, location was generally the most important characteristic, with RR estimates for ever and for current smoking and for all three outcomes always highest in North America, and lowest in China, and (with the exception of ever smoking for squamous) lower in the rest of Asia than in Europe, with no consistent differences seen between results for the United Kingdom, Scandinavia and the rest of Europe.
A number of studies provide RR estimates for ever/current smoking separately by age, and random-effects meta-analysis were conducted, based on the ratio of the estimate for the oldest age group for which data were available compared to that for the youngest.
g Or not known in the case of 10 estimates for all lung cancer, 2 for squamous, and 2 for adeno.
Table 5 presents the results of a main meta-analysis for all lung cancer based on 328 relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) estimates for ever smoking of any product (or cigarettes if any product not available).
