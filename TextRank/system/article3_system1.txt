In most of the cases, the major cause of the failure in the development of drugs to treat brain diseases is the presence of BBB.
This is due to molecular heterogeneity of the brain tumors, presence of CSCs, and lack of effective drug delivery because of the presence of BBB.
Other nanosystems like polymeric micelles and dendrimers are also effective for targeted delivery of drugs to the tumors in the brain.
Existing brain tumor drugs may also be modified to make analogue of the ligand to the particular receptor present in the BBB or the ligand or a peptide can be linked to a drug against the cellular receptors of BBB.
Most of these transporters of BBB regulate the transport of brain tumor drugs by hindering their entry into the tumor regions.
